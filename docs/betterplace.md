##**Usage**

###**Configure** [[**Spenden Formular**]](https://www.spendenformular-direkt.org)

- Go to your client administration
- Configure the "API Callback URL" at ```https://www.spendenformular-direkt./backoffice/clients/YOUR_CLIENT_ID/endpoint/edit```
- Change the "Versandart" to "Als JSON-URL-Parameter" so the CiviCRM API can work with the callback data.
- Add the URL using this schema ```https://DOMAIN/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/rest.php?entity=BPDonation&action=submit&api_key=APIKEY&key=KEY```


| Url Part | Description |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| DOMAIN | Your CiviCRM Domain  |
| APIKEY | The CiviCRM API Key of the contact you wish to use for performing API calls.  |
| KEY | The CiviCRM site key as defined as the constant CIVICRM_SITE_KEY in your civicrm.settings.php file. |


###**Configure CiviCRM**

- Go to the Admin panel ```/civicrm/admin```
- Open "betterplace.org Direkt API Configuration" at ```/civicrm/admin/settings/betterplace```

####Configure a contact for administration-activities

Open "Configure extention settings" at ```/civicrm/admin/settings/betterplace/settings```

####Form:

Provide the CiviCRM-ID of the contact that will receive the activities

####Configure "profiles":

Open "Configure profiles" at ```/civicrm/admin/settings/betterplace/profiles```

The "default" profile is used whenever the plugin cannot match the betterplace.org Direkt form id from any other profile. Therefore the default profile will be used for all newly created betterplace.org Direkt forms.

####Form:

| Label | Description |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Profile name | Internal name, used inside the extension. |
| Form IDs | betterplace.org Direkt form IDs. Separate multiple IDs by commas. Example: ```e1e36e0a-d706-45ce-96b8-8948bee03efe``` |
| Location type | Specify how the address data sent by the form should be categorised in CiviCRM. List is based on your CiviCRM configuration. |
| Campaign | (Optional) Specify if a donation should be attributed to a CiviCRM Campaign. CiviCRM will ignore all attribution that was given inside the betterplace.org Direkt form. |
| Record CreditCard as | Specifiy the payment method for donations via credit card. |
| Record PayPal as | Specifiy the payment method for donations via PayPal. |
| Record SEPA direct debit as | Specifiy the payment method for donations via SEPA direct debit. |
